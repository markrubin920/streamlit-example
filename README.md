# Project Desciption

The purpose of this project was to take a dataset on 900+ GitHub repositories, and create a dashboard from an interesting trend I noticed in the data.

I recognized a strong correlation between low popularity programming languages and stars received, and high use programming languages with forks, collaborators and pulls. This indicates that for low popularity programming languages, GitHub is predominantly a tool to help with existing projects, whereas for more popular programming languages, GitHub is mainly used for creativity and inspiration.
